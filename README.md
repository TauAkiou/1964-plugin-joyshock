This is a modified/rewritten C++ version of the Keyboard/Mouse Injector Plugin written by Carnivorous.

This plugin works with the custom, overclocked version of the 1964 Emulator released by Stolen and Carnivorous, which can be found here: [link](http://www.shootersforever.com/forums_message_boards/viewtopic.php?t=7045)
