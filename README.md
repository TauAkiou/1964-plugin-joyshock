# 1964-plugin-joyshock

This is a modified/rewritten C++ version of the Keyboard/Mouse Injector Plugin written by Carnivorous.

This plugin works with the custom, overclocked version of the 1964 Emulator released by Stolen and Carnivorous, which can be found here: [link](http://www.shootersforever.com/forums_message_boards/viewtopic.php?t=7045)

While this entire plugin was effectively rewritten, the code was primarily copied and readapted from Stolen and Carnivorous' work. A majority of the credit for this project goes to them and the ShootersForever community.

##Features:
* Mouse-style Gyro aiming for the following controllers:
    - Dualshock 4
    - DualSense
    - Switch Pro Controller
    - Joycon Pairs
    
* Extensive input customization.
* Support for up to 4 players.
* Some experimental features:
    - Free Aim (Always-Active Aim Mode)

##Dependencies & Requirements
This plugin only works on Stolen/Carnivorous' GE/PD 1964 hack. Use the link above to find it.

    - QT Framework 5.15.2
